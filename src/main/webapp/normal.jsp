		These next three lines don't really work yet. They are trying to put the value from 
		last saved text into the edit box of current ckeditor. I couldn't find portletSession.getAttribute(...).

		The bPath is written outside of the main form code as for some reason JSP seems to mess up

		The attr is basically for the ckeditor textarea. You can play around with adding more
		html stuff like id/class/etc.
